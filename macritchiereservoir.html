<p>At MacRitchie Reservoir, we learnt the different ways to conserve water and how to do our part as the community to help out. We took a
nice walk around the reservoir, admiring whatever it has offered to us. I think that this was the perfect opportunity to unwind and relax
as we had many projects to complete. Despite the fact that it was really hot, I think we really enjoyed the trip </p>
