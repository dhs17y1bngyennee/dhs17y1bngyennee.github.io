<h1>my trip to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</h1>
          
<p>This is about my trip to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum last week. We were all extremely excited to be able to go to a 
place like this. I was really fascinated by the exhibits that were shown at the museum. I saw huge and amazing exhibits that I have 
never seen before. It was a really fun experience </p>
          
<p> This museum is full of amazing specimens. All of us learnt some very interesting new science terms and words that will definitely 
help us during our science lessons especially in Biology. If you will like to know more, you could visit the museum's website using this
